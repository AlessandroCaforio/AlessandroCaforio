### Research Interests

I study how economic shocks reshape political behavior. My Master's thesis investigates the causal effect of automation-driven task displacement on political ideology in the United States, using shift-share identification and two-way fixed effects on repeated cross-sections (2006-2022).

**Fields**: Applied econometrics, causal inference, computational social science, political economy.
